# Fez AP ![thumbnail](icon.png)

## Overview

This is a [HAT](https://github.com/FEZModding/HAT) mod which adds archipelago multiworld randomizer support to FEZ. It is heavily based on the wonderful [FEZUG](https://github.com/FEZModding/FEZUG).

## Installing

- Follow the instructions to setup HAT.
- Download the latest `FezAP.zip` from the releases tab and place it in your `Mods` folder.
- If all is well, when running `MONOMODDED_FEZ.exe`, you should see the HAT logo with a list of the loaded mods and their versions.

## Usage

- Open a new save.
- Press `\`` to open up the console.
- Type `connect <server> <port> <slot_name> <password (optional)>` (e.g. `connect archipelago.gg 123456 Fez`).
- Type `ready` to indicate readiness.
- Type `say <text>` if you want to send something to the feed (e.g. `say Hello from FEZ`).
- Check all the other functions with `help` in case you need to debug something and get around the AP system.

## Thanks

Big thanks to the Fez Modding community especially Krzyhau for all the incredible tooling and help.
