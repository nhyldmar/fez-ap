# Fez AP ![thumbnail](icon.png)

## Overview

This is a [HAT](https://github.com/FEZModding/HAT) mod which adds archipelago multiworld randomizer support to FEZ. It is recommended to also install [FEZAP](https://github.com/FEZModding/FEZAP) to help with debugging game state.

## Installing

- Follow the instructions to setup HAT.
- Download the latest `FezAP.zip` from the releases tab and place it in your `Mods` folder.
- (Optional) Also download the latest `FEZAP.zip` and place it in `Mods`.
- If all is well, when running `MONOMODDED_FEZ.exe`, you should see the HAT logo with a list of the loaded mods and their versions.

## Thanks

Big thanks to the Fez Modding community especially Krzyhau for all the incredible tooling and help. This mod is heavily based on FEZAP.
